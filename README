This is the Dockstar LCD code.

I used eclipse to build it, so you'd better use eclipse also or simply
use the compiled firmware.

If you wish to use LCD4Linux, you need to use the patched drv_LCD2USB.c driver
found within the lcd4linux directory. Note that this is a quick and dirty hack
and probably disables other LCD2USB-devices you maybe use.
